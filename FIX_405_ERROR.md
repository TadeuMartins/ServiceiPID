# Fix for 405 Error on /describe Endpoint

## Problem
After analyzing a P&ID, the chatbot was not appearing and the backend was returning a **405 Method Not Allowed** error:

```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:60545 - "GET /describe?pid_id=analyzed_20251011_153341 HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
```

## Root Cause
The `/describe` endpoint was defined in the backend as `@app.post("/describe")` but the frontend was calling it with `requests.get()`. This HTTP method mismatch caused the 405 error.

**Backend (backend/backend.py line 1122):**
```python
@app.post("/describe")  # ❌ Defined as POST
async def describe_pid(pid_id: str = Query(...)):
    ...
```

**Frontend (frontend/app.py lines 110, 248):**
```python
desc_response = requests.get(f"{DESCRIBE_URL}?pid_id={pid_id}", timeout=60)  # ❌ Called with GET
```

## Solution
Changed the `/describe` endpoint from **POST** to **GET** in the backend. This makes semantic sense because:
- The endpoint is a **read operation** (fetching/generating a description)
- GET is the standard HTTP method for retrieving data
- No data is being created or modified, just retrieved

**Changes made:**
1. ✅ `backend/backend.py`: Changed `@app.post("/describe")` to `@app.get("/describe")`
2. ✅ `README.md`: Updated documentation from `POST /describe` to `GET /describe`
3. ✅ `CODE_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`: Updated example code
4. ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_CHATBOT.md`: Updated endpoint list
5. ✅ `CHATBOT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Updated API documentation

## Verification
Created test in `test_describe_fix.py` that verifies:
- `/describe` endpoint exists
- Accepts GET requests
- Does NOT accept POST requests

**Test results:**
```
✅ /describe endpoint correctly configured as GET
✅ All tests passed! The 405 error should be fixed.
```

**Server log verification:**
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:54372 - "GET /describe?pid_id=test_id HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request   # ✅ GET accepted
INFO: 127.0.0.1:44830 - "POST /describe?pid_id=test_id HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed  # ✅ POST rejected
```

## Impact
- ✅ The 405 error is now fixed
- ✅ The chatbot should now appear after P&ID analysis
- ✅ Process description will be fetched correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes for other endpoints
- ✅ Follows REST best practices (GET for read operations)
